# Rocket-Recall-Hack-Harvard-23
Alzheimer's is a serious neurodegenerative disease, and having a way to spot it early is incredibly important. Often, however, early signs are both hard to spot and difficult to talk about. Our app is meant to both screen for early signs of Alzheimer's or other forms of cognitive decline over long periods of time, and train your brain against it!Rocket Recall is a web application that is meant to be visited often! Users log in and play daily cognitive games. The purpose of our application is that over time, as users make our daily games a habit and more data on their scores is collected, a downward trajectory in performance can be a big signaler of cognitive decline and an early sign of neuro degeneracy. Our users can send their data to their family or health care providers, so physicians can get the data they need to track progress and screen for issues.
